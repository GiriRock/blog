# Introduction

Hey there! I'm Giridharan Mohan, your friendly neighborhood software engineer who's always up for a coding challenge. I've got a real soft spot for exploring the latest and greatest in technology, and right now, I'm setting my sights on something special – Rust programming. <!-- more -->

In this little corner of the internet, I'll be sharing my adventures as I navigate the fascinating world of Rust. Think of it as a digital diary of a coder on a quest to conquer a new language. I've got this roadmap all mapped out, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.

Expect regular updates on my wins, struggles, and everything in between. And hey, if you're on a coding journey too, maybe my missteps can be your shortcuts. So, buckle up and join me in this coding escapade. Let’s turn these lines of code into stories!

# Installing Rust

Alright, time to roll up our sleeves and get Rust up and running! If you haven't already, head over to the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to embark on this installation journey.

## Using `rustup`

The recommended way to install Rust is through `rustup`, Rust's toolchain installer. It makes managing Rust versions and associated tools a breeze. Here's a quick guide:

1. Visit the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Look for the "Get Started" section.
3. Click on the "Install Rust" link.
4. Follow the instructions for your operating system.

Once `rustup` is installed, you've got the power to easily switch between Rust versions, manage dependencies, and stay on top of updates. It's the Rust developer's best friend.

**Pro Tip:** Open a new terminal window after installation to ensure that Rust is in your system's PATH.

Now that you've got Rust installed, you're armed and ready for the coding adventures that lie ahead. Next up, let's set up our development environment. Stay tuned!

# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Alright, let's get cozy in our coding habitat! For this Rust journey, I've decided to make Visual Studio Code (VSCode) my home. Why? Because it's like a treasure chest for coders with its myriad of features and that sweet, sweet plugin support.

## Installing Visual Studio Code

If you don't have VSCode installed, head over to the [official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and grab yourself a copy. It's free, it's fantastic, and it's our canvas for Rust masterpieces.

## Rust Extensions

To make our Rust coding experience even more delightful, I've got a trio of VSCode extensions to recommend:

### 1. [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer)

This extension is like having a coding companion who anticipates your every move. It provides intelligent code completion, real-time diagnostics, and powerful refactoring tools. Trust me, it's a game-changer.

### 2. [Crates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serayuzgur.crates)

This nifty extension lets you explore and search for Rust crates (libraries) right from within VSCode. A handy tool for discovering and managing dependencies without breaking a sweat.

### 3. [Rust Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dustypomerleau.rust-syntax)

For that extra touch of visual goodness, this extension enhances Rust syntax highlighting in your code. It might seem like a small thing, but a dash of color can make your code pop!

**Installation Tip:** Open VSCode, head to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), and search for these extensions to install them with a click.

Now that we've decked out our VSCode with Rust-friendly tools, we're ready to dive into the coding magic. In the next update, we'll get our hands dirty with our first Rust program. Stay tuned!
